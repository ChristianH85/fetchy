# Fetchy
```For science```
## Description
```SoFetch is a simple browser based REST API testing app. Currently SoFetch will execute fetch GET commands to API endpoints and supports the use of headers, params, and queries. Other CRUD functions have been programmed but have yet to be tested. Future development will seek to integrate a backend to support api testing for cors support.```

### method
```Using the convienient dropdown a user can choose between different methods of request```

### url
```Here a user can input a url endpoint and add queries and params as needed.```

### body
```A user can enter in a body object to send to the endpoint. Syntax matters though the JSON will be parsed before sending for format.```

### headers
```Users can also send headers as an object. Same syntax rules apply as for body.``` 

## Usage
```After inputting the data for a query a user can Fetch it to execute a fetch request. The result will output a number respresenting the status code with a green font for successful request and a red one for failed request. Additionally the output of the response will be printed to the page```

## Error handling
```If a request is unsuccessful then it will render an error status code if the error resulted in transit or they will recieve an error message if the error failed in sending. Some sort of syntax checking would be nice to have```

## Contributing
```This is a relatively small project but I am open to suggestions and pull request```
